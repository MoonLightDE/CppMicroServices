mlde.l.cppmicroservices for Debian
----------------------------------

microcppservices was in early stage when moonlight desktop started.. this its a fork

the paths to install does not follow the standars, so here the aux files are the cmake paths

those paths was set manually respect multiarch support in the rules file.
